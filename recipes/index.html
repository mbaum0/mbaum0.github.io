        <div class="section-title">Perfect Pizza Dough</div>
        <hr>
        <div class="section-body">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 3/4c (420g) lukewarm water</li>
                <li>2tsp. (5g) dry active yeast</li>
                <li>4 1/2c (625g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2tsp. (5g) kosher salt (or just any kind of salt)</li>
                <li>2tbsp. (28g) olive oil (you can sub with canola or any vegetable oil here, but I find it has a big impact on taste)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Dough Prep</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir warm water and yeast together in a large mixing bowl and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Add in flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix with your hands until you've made a big ol shaggy mess</li>
                <li>Dust counter with flour and place your dough on it. Kneed for 5 minutes. Add flour if necessary. When it comes to dryness, the dough should be just past the point of sticky. It shouldn't be sticking to your hands.</li>
                <li>Once you're happy with the consistency and the dough is thoroughly mixed, form a rough ball and cut into four equal pieces.</li>
                <li>Round up the pieces into balls, dust with flour (you'll thank me later) and place into individual baggies.</li>
                <li>You can freeze the dough up to the inevitable heat death of the universe (untested). Otherwise, refrigerate up to a week (also untested).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When ready to make, take dough out of freezer or fridge and place on counter in a lightly flour-dusted bowl and cover in plastic wrap. The goal here is to minimize air exposure to the dough.</li>
                <li>Let the dough sit until it is room temperature. This is the most difficult step of the whole process. The dough should not be cool to the touch. 1.5-2ish hours from fridge, longer from freezer.</li>
                <li>Seriously, the last step is important. Room temperature dough is a must. Go for a jog or eat a snack while you wait. Sometimes I start a new game of civ 5 and forget about pizza altogether. Your call.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)</li>
                <li>Spread the dough. Don't roll it. There are some great Youtube videos out there that can help with this.</li>
                <li>Cover with your preferred toppings</li>
                <li>Bake for ~10 minutes. Keep and eye on the crust. Wait for it to brown if you prefer crispier, or take out earlier if you like softer</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>

        <div class="section-title">Sourdough Bread</div>
        <hr>
        <div class="section-body">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>230g active (fed) sourdough starter</li>
                <li>~3g dry active yeast</li>
                <li>340g warm water</li>
                <li>15g salt (I usually use kosher)</li>
                <li>600g unbleached all-purpose flour. (Type 550 for those in Germany or 12% or more protein content)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Dough Prep</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir all ingredients together in a large mixing bowl until a sticky and uniform ball of dough forms. ~2 minutes</li>
                <li>Cover bowl and allow to rise until doubled in size. ~90 minutes</li>
                <li>Split dough into two pieces (we'll be making two loaves)</li>
                <li>Shape dough into a ball, using flour to prevent it sticking to the work surface and hands. Spread the dough from the top, pulling the sides underneath the ball, forming a seam there. This will ensure the bread has a smooth crust.</li>
                <li>Set ball on a lightly floured or greased surface, cover (I use cling wrap), and let rest for 20 minutes</li>
                <li>Gently roll the dough ball back and forth to elongate it into loaf-form. Ensure that the seem stays on the bottom. I shoot for about 10 inches in length.</li>
                <li>Set the dough on parchment on a baking sheet, or gently place into a greased loaf pan. Cover, and let rise until puffy ~1 hour</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425f (220c)</li>
                <li>Once puffy, make two deep diagonal slashes along the length of the dough. (I don't do this when baking in a loaf pan)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Set pan in the oven. If using a loaf pan, set a foil tent on top to prevent over browning.</li>
                <li>Bake until the bread is golden brown in color. About 25-30 minutes. If using a loaf pan, I like to remove the foil tent for the last 5 minutes or so.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and let the bread rest on a cooling rack without the pan.</li>
                <li>Wait until it is relatively cooled before slicing. Enjoy!</li>
